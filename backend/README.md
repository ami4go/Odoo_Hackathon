# ReWear – Community Clothing Exchange 👕♻️

A web-based platform that enables users to exchange unused clothing through direct swaps or a point-based redemption system. Built for Odoo Hackathon '25.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

This project is based on **Problem Statement 3: ReWear – Community Clothing Exchange**, from the official Odoo Hackathon '25 problem statements.

The goal is to promote sustainable fashion and reduce textile waste by encouraging users to reuse wearable garments instead of discarding them.
